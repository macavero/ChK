# Nucleated outside out patch clamp 

This repository contains analysis of patch-clamp electrophysiological recordings from human and mouse neurons. The goal is to explore how electrophysiological properties relate to species, transcriptomic identity (type, subclass, and class), and recording modality, with a focus on nucleated outside-out patch clamp data.

The codebase is structured around Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks, and includes tools for data visualization, exploratory analysis, and subtype-level comparisons across species.

## Main Features
- Analysis of current ratios, recovery kinetics, and peak current densities  
- Comparison of transcriptomic neuron types across species  

## üìÅ Note
Raw data files are not included in this repository.
